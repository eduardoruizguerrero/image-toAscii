# image-toAscii
Convert your image to ASCII format.
## Editing code!.
To edit the characters shown on the screen you must modify the const **'chars'**.  
To edit the number of characters shown on the screen, you must modify the const variables **'sizeWidth'** and **'sizeHeight'**, this number follows an _aspect ratio_, please **maintain it**, remember, the larger the numbers, the smaller the image will be end.  
The images are saved in the _localstorage_, **so maybe the image you select is not the one that will show you now, but the next one**, you can play with that by sending the rendered image to another page and then return the user to the original page, etc.
