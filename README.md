# image-toAscii
Convert your image to ASCII format.
## Editing code!.
To edit the characters shown on the screen you must modify the const **'chars'**.  
To edit the number of characters shown on the screen, you must modify the const variables **'sizeWidth'** and **'sizeHeight'**, this number follows an _aspect ratio_, please **maintain it**, remember, the larger the numbers, the smaller the image will be end.
The images are saved in temporary variable, you can change the image in real time without refresh page :D!.
Now you can copy the ascii image, and clear the content, OR MODIFY THE CHARS IN REAL TIME :D!!!!!.
Now you can DOWNLOAD A PICTURE LIKE ASCII IMAGE!!!!.
To end, I improved the code, thanks for using the code to here or in vercel page.

### Thanks for reading :D!.
